  Meant to back up Hash AnimationMaster project files.

INTRODUCTION

I wrote this program because I got real tired of
Hash:AnimationMaster's crashing and trashing my 3D projects.  

We users of Hash:AM put lots of time and effort into our projects, and
for our tool to simply explode and take out our work is nightmarishly
sinister, ironic, and just plain frustrating.  But it happens with
even the best of programs, so here's where little scrappy tools like
this one can help us all out.

It's written in Tcl.  Tcl is a nifty "glue" language commonly used for
basic file-processing, and simple GUI applications.  You can browse
the source code and pretty much pick up what is going on inside, it's
a pretty short script.

If you like it, it would make my day if you sent me an email at
ncr100@yahoo.com.  Tell me that it works perfectly too, btw.  That
really would make my day.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

MICROSOFT WINDOWS

Use the pre-packaged executable PRJSaver.exe.


APPLE MACINTOSH

Use the raw script, plus a Tcl interpreter.  Macintosh has not been
tested, though it should work fine.  Let me know about your success 
ncr100@yahoo.com.

Downloading a Tcl interpreter (Mac): 

If you don't have MS Windoze, see http://tcl.activestate.com for more
information about an available TCL/TK interpreter.

INSTALLING AND RUNNING

MICROSOFT WINDOWS
* Copy PRJSaver anywhere and double click.
* See "ALL" instructions below.

APPLE MACINTOSH
* Copy PRJSaver anywhere.
* Install Tcl/Tk interpreter (need its "WISH" program especially).
* ???? Double click PRJSaver.prj to run the raw script through WISH.
* See "ALL" instructions below.
* IF this doesn't work, you'll have to "source prjsaver.prj" from
  WISH, :( .  I may be able to help you figure out better instructions
  for this if you Macs email me directly.

ALL
* Click the Browse... button and pick the file you want backed up.  
* Now click the big "Backup" button at the bottom of the screen.
* Every 15 seconds the program will check to see if the project file
  has been updated via the file's modification timestamp.  If this 
  is newer than the last one PRJSaver saw, it will make a backup.
* Backups are labeled Project_[num].prj so  
   Project1.prj
  becomes
   Project1_0.prj
   Project1_1.prj
   Project1_2.prj
   ...
